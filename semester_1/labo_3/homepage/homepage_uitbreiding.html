        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>Exercising</h3>
            <p>Contrary to popular stereotypes about programmers, I'm actually a really active person. From
                running and cycling to lifting weights at the gym, I try to get at least one activity in
                every day. You can take a look at <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/66503912">my Strava profile</a>, I use it to track a
                lot of my activities, it helps to keep track of statistics too.</p>

            <h3>Photography &amp; travelling</h3>
            <p>I have travelled to tons of countries, 26 in total, you can check out a map of my travels <a href="myVisitedPlaces.html">here</a>.
                Two years ago I also picked up a new hobby, photography, and I have since taken my camera on a couple of my trips. I regularly post the pictures
                I took of these trips on my dedicated
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/efrain_m.photography?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">Instagram page.</a></p>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>Music is one of my biggest hobbies as it goes along with all the previous ones, I listen to music when exercising, travelling and pretty much
                anything else. Not only do I listen to music, I also play two instruments; the guitar and the piano. I've been playing the electric and acoustic
                guitar for only two months now, mainly electric, but have learned lots of songs. As for piano, I have been playing on and off for about three years.
                I bought all my music equipment and instruments at <a href="https://www.thomann.de/be/index.html">Thomann</a>, they are the largest seller of anything
                that has something to do with music.</p>
