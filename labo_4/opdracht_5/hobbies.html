    <h3>Exercising</h3>
    <p>Contrary to popular stereotypes about programmers, I'm actually a really active person. From
        running and cycling to lifting weights at the gym, I try to get at least one activity in
        every day. You can take a look at <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/66503912">my Strava profile</a>, I use it to track a
        lot of my activities, it helps to keep track of statistics too.</p>

    <h3>Photography &amp; travelling</h3>
    <p>I have travelled to tons of countries, 26 in total, you can check out a map of my travels <a href="myVisitedPlaces.html">here</a>.
        Two years ago I also picked up a new hobby, photography, and I have since taken my camera on a couple of my trips. I regularly post the pictures
        I took of these trips on my dedicated

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>Music is one of my biggest hobbies as it goes along with all the previous ones, I listen to music when exercising, travelling and pretty much
        anything else. Not only do I listen to music, I also play two instruments; the guitar and the piano. I've been playing the electric and acoustic
        guitar for only two months now, mainly electric, but have learned lots of songs. As for piano, I have been playing on and off for about three years.
        I bought all my music equipment and instruments at <a href="https://www.thomann.de/be/index.html">Thomann</a>, they are the largest seller of anything
        that has something to do with music.</p>
